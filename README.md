### Description

It's a test project using react.js and pwa.
<br />
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br />
The main goal of this project is to compare [pwa](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-react), [react-native](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-react-native) and [flutter](https://github.com/vdyakov/todo-list-flutter) in writing a to-do application.

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### PWA check
